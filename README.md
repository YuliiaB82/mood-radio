The general idea of a project lies in that every colour represent specific emotion (e.g. orange colour corresponds to energy and creativity). With a knowledge of emotion which is associated with specific colour, it is possible to connect music tracks or playlists which could help the user to improve study/work activities.

My idea for project is create my own radio with music that I like. I will be able to share it with friends, go to artist´s album to another resource, for example spotify.

```
function getTrack (trackName, artistName) {
  let track = `${trackName} by ${artistName}`;
  console.log(track);
}
getTrack(`Yellow`, `Coldplay`);
```
